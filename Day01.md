Day 01 â€“ SDLC & DevOps Basics
1. Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)

SDLC is a structured process that defines different phases in software development, ensuring quality, efficiency, and proper delivery.

Phases of SDLC:

Planning â†’ Define project goals, scope, resources, cost, and risks.

Requirement Analysis â†’ Gather and analyze both functional and non-functional requirements.

Design â†’ Convert requirements into a blueprint (architecture, UI, components).

Implementation (Coding) â†’ Actual development and coding take place.

Testing â†’ Conduct unit, integration, system, and user acceptance testing.

Deployment â†’ Deliver the software to users after testing.

Maintenance / Evolution â†’ Fix bugs, release updates, and improve the product.

2. SDLC Models

There are different approaches to follow SDLC, the two most common are:

Waterfall Model

Linear and sequential.

Each phase must be completed before moving to the next.

Less flexible, harder to adapt to changes.

Best for small projects with clear requirements.

Agile Model

Iterative and flexible.

Development happens in short cycles (sprints).

Continuous collaboration, testing, and feedback.

Best for complex projects where requirements evolve.

3. DevOps Life Cycle

DevOps integrates Development and Operations teams to ensure faster and continuous delivery.

Stages:

Plan â†’ Define features and requirements.

Code â†’ Developers write the application code.

Build â†’ Code is compiled and packaged.

Test â†’ Automated/manual tests ensure quality.

Release â†’ Approved builds are prepared for deployment.

Deploy â†’ Software is deployed into production.

Operate â†’ System is run and used by end-users.

Monitor â†’ Continuous monitoring for performance, errors, and logs.

ðŸ’¡ DevOps emphasizes Continuous Development, Integration, Deployment, and Monitoring, making delivery faster and more reliable.
